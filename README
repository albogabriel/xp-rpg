An agile project management simulation inspired in James King's and Phillippe Kruchten's Agile Release Planning Game.

This project was part of the final paper for my Information Systems degree at PUCRS, in Porto Alegre, Brazil.

While the conceptual goal of the paper was achieved, the software still needs some features to be implemented and the code needs refactoring and test coverage on several parts.
